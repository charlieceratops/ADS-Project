# Places To Go
Places To Go is the result of a group project for the subject Algorithms and Data Structures at IE University and is being developed by Manuel Concepción, Tom Frerèux-Sanchez, Carlos González and Sophie Monga. The product consists of an application that allows users to store information about places/locations they find interesting and notifies them whenever those places are inside a range defined by the user. Version 0 of the product makes use of Hash Tables, Weighted Graphs and Greedy Algorithms to build a mock-up map and a simulation of how the notification, place-saving and other functions would work.

##INSTALLATION
Download the code and upload it to Google Collaboratory or a Jupyter Notebook.

##USAGE
Execute all the necessary cells to build the map.

Once the map is built, play with the functions to save places, edit them and the notification function.

###Function to save places

###Notification Function

For the notification function you will have to call the function with the range, a list of the saved places and the current location where you are at, this is, notify(range,saved_places,loc_randomlocation)

The result will output a list of all the places saved and in the range you defined in ascending order by such distance
